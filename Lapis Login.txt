Features:
    Password Security:
    Uses hashing and salting to secure passwords in such a way that even I can't tell you what they are

    Simple and Fast:
    Because I haven't put in a lot of fancy features the plugin is lite and easy to run making it perfect for small and massive servers

    Ability to only require some players to register:
    If you don't want all players to need to register then you only need to give the permission to the players you want to be required to register.
    other players can still register if they wish but it wont be a requirement. this might be handy if you want to force staff to secure their account but don't want to force players to.
Commands:

Permissions:
lapislogin.admin: allows the player to reset other players passwords with /resetpassword
